    <p>Prefix sums is a static data structure which we use to solve query problem in constant time.<br>
    <h4><b>Let's define prefix sums</b><br></h4>
    Given an array 'a' of n integer
    prefix[i] = ∑a[j] , where 0<=j<=i;
    we consider everything zero base indices

    <br>
    So let's solve problem using prefix sums

    You're given an array 'a' of n integer and 'q' query and in each query given 'l' and 'r' 
    and you need to evaulate ∑a[i] , l<=i<=r

    <br>
    The naive solution would be like for each query we'll iterate from l to r and increment in our answer
    Complexity will be O(linear)
    and for 'q' query it'll be O(linear*q)
    which is not good Complexity
    <br>

    Let's see how can we solve this problem using prefix sums;
